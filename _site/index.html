								<h2>40 Days Without Food: divine goodness to a starving soul</h2>
									<h3>Nonfiction / Memoir  • 2011</h3>
									<p>"I had a college degree, and soon a seminary degree to accompany it, yet I didn't know where to go or what to do." As he puts it, "I kept hoping a step would arrive when it was time to lift my foot."</p>
									<p>Disillusioned with his life, as well as with God, he heard this advice: fast from food for 40 days. Faithless and frazzled, Russ accepted the challenge, hoping for direction, reflecting on the past, and wrestling with issues like purpose, faith, and love.</p>
									<p>In this book, readers will find a fresh literary voice--an insightful thinker who meets people in their humanity while helping them to see they can be rescued from it. The journey of these forty days without food will help you explore what really matters in life</p>
									<p class='quote'>"Though quite entertaining, and casual in style, 40 Days without Food caused me to confront the motives behind my daily actions. The book is a short, yet profound, look at what it means to truly live--something today's fast-paced society woefully lacks."
			- Jim Reimann, editor of bestselling books <em>My Utmost for His Highest</em> and <em>Streams in the Desert</em></p>
									<p class='quote'>"Russ tells a story filled with contemplative and entertaining insight. His prose proclaims the faithfulness of God is experienced bit by bit in slow drawls as much as in sudden blinding epiphanies."
			- Jordan Green, editor of burnsidewriters.com and the book, <em>Besides the Bible.</em></p>
